# Customer-Clustering
A demo project aimed at developing a clustering model based on customer data using K-Means algorithm.
Python is the language applied in the whole process of this work.
Libraries applied in achieviement of task goals include: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Bivariate analysis was explored in determining feature relationships before modelling procedure.
Modelling process was instantiated with an object of the K-Means algorithm.
Cluster selection was achieved using elbow method, this yielded  5 clusters as best choice for the dataset.
Dataset was sourced from kaggle.com
